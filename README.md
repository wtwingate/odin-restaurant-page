# odin-restaurant-page

An example restaurant page made for The Odin Project.

## About

The purpose of this example project was twofold: 1) to gain some experience with configuring and using webpack to build a website, and 2) to practice DOM manipulation using vanilla JavaScript. The pages are dynamically rendered by building up the DOM elements one by one, and using event listeners on the nav buttons to switch between page views.

Doing this with vanilla JavaScript and the DOM API was pretty tedious, and I freely used Copilot to help with the repetitive boilerplate. This little project has really opened my eyes to the reasons why modern front-end frameworks like React and Astro were created in the first place.

## Build

To run the website locally, run `npm install` to download all the dependencies, and then run `npx webpack serve` to fire up the development server.
